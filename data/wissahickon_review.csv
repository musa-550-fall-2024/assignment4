04/10/2024 18:02:42,Pete Rhein,118156100062911374661,"The best wilderness inside Philadelphia. A few hundred feet from the entrance and the city will disappear. There will be other Philadelphians enjoying it, but if you try a little you can get lost and alone. (That's meant to be positive.) Please don't litter, and if ya see someone else's litter, try and carry it to the next rubbish can. It's our park. Want to help more? The Friends of Wissahickon do a great job planting and rebuilding and maintaining, all on their own time and dime!",5

Rough stone and rock strewn paths, fallen trees across paths, up and down hills. But a great physical experience with eye catching beauty each step.

But, BUT be careful.",5

The police were rude and not helpful at all. Just writing/collecting reports for statistics. According to them this happens multiple times a day. BEWARE!!!",2

02/05/2024 01:07:49,Paul Butler,116510255677657262802,"Preserved when Philadelphia was but a fledgling town to protect the water source for this soon to be great town, the park has been the focus of Philadelphians for generations. Many of the trails and buildings throughout the park have lengthy histories not limited to, but including the Valley Green restaurant - one of the last examples of a restaurant for when the primary mode of transit was horses, it was a place to get some good catfish and waffles. The park also holds Philadelphia's last covered bridge. Much of the parks trails originate from Franklins WPA programs for infrastructure projects. There's a wide variety of trails and oddities to see a long the way. Though not one of Philadelphia's tourist hotspots, it certainly should be. Don't be surprised to see people with their dogs, on horses, or bikes. Today we even saw a dog sled at work. Spend lunch along the scenic trails, take a walk, photos, or hike one of the more hilly routes. Be prepared, there are frequently wet areas that are run off from the hills on either side of the valley. Mud is a constant, but the views are worth it. Parking can be a challenge so plan ahead.",5
02/03/2024 04:29:12,Agnes Richardson,113039305632006097279,"The Wissahickon Valley Park would be a wonderful place. The only downside is that some very ignorant dog owners disregard laws, and their dogs run around wild. It‚Äôs really a shame that irresponsible dog owners ruin the recreation area for others with their illegal behavior.
Over the years, many unleashed dogs scared me, and several (!) even jumped at me on the Lavender Trail. Of interest, their very ignorant owners would of course insist their dogs are ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù. At this point, I cannot enjoy a walk in the park because I am no edge, worried another dog running around wild will get me.
To my fellow Chestnut Hillers and visitors from elsewhere: Leash your dog. It‚Äôs the law. Stop ruining the park experience for others. If you don‚Äôt like the park rules, simply take your dog elsewhere, where unleashed dogs are allowed, and please stay out of the Wissahickon Valley Park.",3

01/11/2024 20:05:54,Justin Walker,100157023713132916041,"Absolutely love this park. I'm spoiled rotten because I live a block away and I get to explore any time I want. This park has been become a part of my everyday life and workout routine, and has helped me get into the best shape I've been in years. It has miles of trails for hiking, running, cycling, and horseback riding for all skill levels. Safe for children and dog friendly. A few spots for fishing and swimming. Unique and interesting historical monuments like Kelpius' cave and The Devil's Pool in addition to landmarks like The Historic Rittenhouse town. which hosts a delightful cafe and bike rent shop, A functioning paper mill that sometimes hosts school kids, and even a small holistic center. It shares land with The Walnut Lane Golf Club, and The Philadelphia Cricket Club, as well as the Kitchen Lane horse stables and Saul Agricultural High School. Last but not least, it has The Valley Park Inn, one of the best restaurants in the City! There is so much more i could mention but I've said enough. Please come by and visit if you were considering it. Not too many options with restrooms, or parking for that matter but that doesn't really effect me because I can just walk there. Overall this park is wonderful!!",5

Forbidden drive which runs along the Wissahickon creek is wide and able to accommodate large numbers of hikers bikers walkers and joggers. Horse back riding dirt biking trail challenges nature hikes bird watching historical sites and statues. The only covered bridge in a major city in America. Places to eat at each end of Forbidden Drive and The Valley Green Inn about halfway in the park. Come out and get some exercise fresh air and treat yourself to a beverage and a bite to eat.,5

These rare occasions fill me with an intense sense of wonder balanced with being very present in the moment. Tonight's run on Forbidden Drive is one I'll remember for a long time.

If you're gonna name your trail Forbidden Drive then it better be a heck of an adventure. Tucked away in the Wissahickon valley, this gravel path follows along the banks of the winding creek. Each twist and rolling hill beckons you to explore a little deeper.

The entire run I was at war with myself over wanting to slow down and take in the sights and absolutely tear through the scenery. I opted for both. The first half supplied the photos you see while the second acted as a race against the quickly setting sun in the valley.

10/10/2023 02:14:35,Stephan Shugart,112911516748913811807,The mountain bikes have ruined hiking. They are rude and wicked toward. Hikers. The bikes have ruined the trails by exposing rocks and erosion everywhere. Almost every state and national park system in the country have outlawed them. They came from everywhere New Jersey Delaware Montgomery County and ride these once nice hiking trails. Bikes have become Traffic on the trails scaring wild life and even riding at night with those very powerful headlights. It's a crying shame our beautiful parks are being ravaged by them. Our parks are for enjoying nature not for fun and games at the expense of the environment. Band the bikes keep them off the trails and keep them on roads only. There is no IP ne repairing the damage they do it's only getting worse and worse.,1

""No swimming"" signs are posted but they seem to be ignored by humans. Lots of poison ivy this time of year (late August) so be careful where you step. It lines a lot of the paths. If you're not super active, know that there are benches every fifty feet or so along the tow path. I'd say this park has something for everyone. Keep an eye out for bikers, not all of them will give you a verbal warning. If you have a dog on an extendable leash, I'd advise against it. Beautiful park with lots of winding trails.

There isn't 1 spot along that path with access to the river without 10+ individuals already posted up staring you down as if you're purpose is to fight for their territory. After about a mile or so walking, we found 1 spot to fish from and that lasted all about 20 minutes before a family of 6+ stood directly behind us staring with deep intent and continuously trying to make themselves known, as if to say ""this is our mound of dirt and our bathing beach- not yours.""

From the lush green scenery to the Wissahickon Creek with it's rapids and waterfalls... it's just an absolutely breathtaking place to spend an entire day. As you walk the trails there are benches and picnic tables everywhere. It's so incredibly peaceful and even when the park looks like it may be crowded you can still find quiet nooks to chill. The variety of flora and fauna is just beautiful. Keep an eye out for the turltles in the creek!,5
06/17/2023 23:24:56,Mikayla Bandomer,116805286822945495175,"Without a doubt this is one of the most beautiful hikes you could go on. The trails are located along the river and vary in difficulty. Depending on where you start your hike, one side of the river has a well kept paved walkway, while the other side has a natural trail. The paved walkway is wide which easily accommodates the crowd of visitors that visit on summer weekends. The trails on the other side of the river are great for a challenge. You will encounter boulders to climb over, small cliffs to look out from, and stone stairways that help you navigate the steepest areas. The only negative I have on this place is the crowds. On weekends you will definitely find yourself walking by groups of people playing loud music and drinking, which is against the parks rules. If this was enforced more, it would deserve 11 out of 10 stars.",5

Se encuentra a solo unos minutos del centro de la ciudad y ofrece un oasis de tranquilidad y belleza natural. Es una opci√≥n ideal para aquellos que buscan escapar del bullicio de la ciudad y sumergirse en el aire fresco y la naturaleza.

Wissahickon Valley Park cuenta con m√°s de 1.800 hect√°reas de bosques, arroyos, valles y colinas que se extienden a lo largo de varios kil√≥metros. Los senderos para caminar, correr, andar en bicicleta y montar a caballo est√°n bien mantenidos y son accesibles para todo tipo de niveles de habilidad.

Para los amantes de la naturaleza, el parque ofrece una gran variedad de flora y fauna que incluye ciervos, zorros, conejos, aves y una gran cantidad de √°rboles y plantas nativas. Adem√°s, el r√≠o Wissahickon atraviesa el parque, lo que proporciona una maravillosa vista del agua y la tranquilidad que puede ofrecer.

La arquitectura hist√≥rica tambi√©n es un atractivo importante de este parque. Hay varios puentes, molinos y presas que se remontan a la era colonial de los Estados Unidos. Estos elementos no solo ofrecen una vista espectacular, sino que tambi√©n cuentan una parte importante de la historia de la regi√≥n.

En resumen, Wissahickon Valley Park es un lugar hermoso y tranquilo que ofrece una gran variedad de actividades para todas las edades y habilidades. Es una excelente opci√≥n para aquellos que buscan un escape de la ciudad y sumergirse en la naturaleza y la historia.",5

The reason for my 3 star review is due to the fact the park needed a lot more guidance and supervision during that holiday weekend. There was a young male driver in a pickup truck that came speeding in way too fast and he almost hit a child in the process. He was driving to the parking lot after crossing the bridge and had to be going 35 or 40 mph. That was very disappointing and scary to witness.

Theses were unpaved, trickey to navigate, full of rocks and fallen trees. Definitely comfortable shoes and outerwear a must.
The sound of the stream was relaxing and the reflecting view of nature (tree branches,rocks) was beautiful.
There are many trails going different directions. There was a crosswalk on the main road to access trail on the otherside. However, the main road includes a bridge with no sidewalk lots of traffic, and a very narrow shoulder. Best to cross facing the oncoming traffic.

Narrow bridge to get across to the wider walking path is unsafe with minimal room but able to manage due to stop signs and cross walks. Relies on people following traffic laws as most things do when it comes to safety.

Stone tables can be found along with benches and access to the stream that runs through the park. My child enjoyed throwing rocks in the water and it wasn't too busy on a weekday morning. It definitely gets busy in the afternoon and on the weekends so if you want a quiet flat woods walk going at a less busy time would be important.

Shady wooded trails for hiking:

I went there with a group last Sunday, 07/20/2019. Although the weather was hot, it was much cooler and nice in the park.

Lots of people swimming in the river. And a lot of families with kids picnicked and even cooked at the river bed.
Young people were having fun jumping from the bridge into the river, some jumping into the pond down another bridge in the valley. Looked fun but really dangerous.

If you go hiking, better go earlier as when we left after noontime, lots of families were coming to the valley. Then we even got caught at the traffic when we were exiting the park.",5

Miles of trials to walk or bike. It does get muddy after rain but on a hot summer day lots of tree and leaves to make shade.

Hiking, running, bouldering, horseback riding and mountain biking are all on offer here and we saw people enjoying each of them. We wound our way down to the creek after passing under the Walnut bridge. We would go on to pass under the bridge two more times. One where the arches are decorated in stunning art.

The point we wanted to reach was Hermit's Cave. While the cave itself wasn't much, the journey to get there was delightful. In all we hiked 3.6 miles with 450 ft of elevation gain. We are already excited to return here and explore more. Tentatively planning to try out trail running next weekend.",5

The river, the winding hillside trails, the bridges, the horses (THE HORSES), all of it is wonderful.

Fond memories with family and summer camp.  Locals refer commonly to that specie area as simply Valley Green.  Even visited as part of summer camp activites.

We (me and my family, featured in some of the photos for scale) hiked on a hot humid day but with racing waters and an abundance of shade from giant trees it was barely noticeable.  While  we didn't have time to traverse all the different trails the one we took was one I would consider a more intense hike.  Lots of rocks of varying sizes, tree roots, up hill, some climbing depending on your skill level. Someone used to the terrain might not have to resort to using their hands to get past certain parts, but my daughter had moments of scrambling up certain sections.  Some light water crossing (if you're careful you can stay dry!  Otherwise bring water resistant shoes).

There were people swimming in the water, though I believe there are signs saying not to.  So swim at your risk!  Though the water looked extremely inviting.

Speaking of looking... The scenery is breath taking!  Gorgeous views at every turn.

If you live in or near the Philadelphia area don't skip out on this one!",5

If you want to get lost in nature, this is the right place, there are trails in all directions. It‚Äôs really pleasant cool forest area, trails are marked, but sometimes you will get lost. It‚Äôs a mix of river, wetlands and forest. Some parts of the trails are a bit sunny but most parts have shades.

We had a great weekendüòò

*There is no FEE, there are several parking lots.
It is hard to get parking in the main parking lots, the one near to the valley green inn and the upper parking lot, but there are several other parking lots.

MUST HAVE:
* Use hiking shoes üëü.
* Carry water bottle.
Enjoy your day!.",5

With the multiple entrances and miles of trails even after 20+ visits we still haven't explored it all. Cell service is iffy, GPS can get a little confused, but the map they sell is the exact one on the map stations and online, so not really worth it.

07/30/2020 07:53:49,Brian Valentine,106500477321266858429,"I have been to the park many times and every trip is a new adventure. Miles of trails of varying degrees of difficulty, all well marked and formed into loops with criss crossing interconnected trails that stradle both sides of the Wissahickon river. There is a main thoroughfare walkway with a gravel surface and little elevation change. For the more adventerous all the trails that branch off of it are a typical mountain trail with varying degrees of incline and elevation change and composed of dirt and rock. There are caves, wildlife, flora, waterfalls, swimming spots, places to climb, picnic, bridges, and a path on top of a historic aquaduct that brought water into Philadelphia. Parking is easy and in most areas free, and pet friendly. If hiking isnt you speed bring the mountain bike! Want horsepower? There is no better experience than taking in the fresh air and scenery while in the saddle. The park is well maintained and very clean. It is the largest city park in the nation and minutes from center city. I definitely recommend a visit.",5

It is very lovely to walk by the water, but there is one spot where two families of geese with goslings were congregated; naturally, the parents were hissing at everyone that walked by, but that is instinctive. The trail is concrete and asphalt, and everyone on it is very polite. There are other, more difficult trails, with grades ranging from around 8% - 10%.

I found Wissahickon Valley Park early in the morning this past Sunday and we decided to go explore. 45 minutes later at about 10:15am we arrived and it was GORGEOUS! We took about a 2 hour hike threw some awesome trails. Everything was going great until our bank called my husbands phone explaining to us that my debit and credit cards were being used for abnormally large amounts in Philly around 10:30. We shortly returned to our car that had a busted out drivers side window and my wallet and phone were both gone. The car next to us had a window busted out also. Down the entire parking lot was busted glass all over the ground. Never even noticed it. My wallet wasent in plain site and ive left it in my car so many times while hiking. Lesson learned! Be aware of your surroundings. This could happen anywhere at anytime. Police were called but 2 hours later and no show. Im sure there are much more relevant crimes happening in Philadelphia then a busted out car window and a stollen phone and wallet. It was more relevant to me and an invasion of privacy more then anything. I giant inconvenience. These guys had to watch us walk away from our car. They were charging hundreds of dollars on my card 15 minutes after I arrived at the park. Dont be fooled by how pretty or woodsy the park is. Stay woke!

08/26/2019 00:19:16,Hannah,107906092279349984679,"This is my favorite place to hike, not just because it's near enough for me to walk to, but the hiking trails are extensive and run along a valley. So, while it seems like the deep woods, you are less than a mile from civilization, shops and restaurants. The environment is gorgeous, along the Wissahickon creek with rivlets running down the valley and lots of stone outcroppings and changes in elevation along the trails. If you need something less strenuous, you can stroll along the wide and even Forbidden Drive (named because it was forbidden to drive cars on it) and stop at the historic Valley Green Inn to rest and take in the scenery. History is everywhere. The Lenni Lenape were here before the European settlers were picnicing on the banks of the creek. Poe wrote about it's wonders during the time he lived in Philadelphia. You'll see now sealed fountains where travelers would stop for a drink.
Quick tip: If you're looking for ""the Indian"" statue (aka Tedyuscung on some signs) use the Rex Ave access. The covered bridge is on Chestnut Hill Ave access.
I would advise against parking at the lot on Valley Green road unless you want your car broken into. (And NEVER leave valuables in your car. Good life tip in general.) It is a very secluded place. There are a few spots at the Chestnut Hill access point or along the dead end of the Rex access point. Or find parking on a side street in the neighborhood and walk an extra 15 minutes.",5

I've been recently diving into my newest hobby of mountain biking, but more so my absolute obsession with nature itself. If you're interested in taking a stroll through life, look no further. They say to walk in nature is to witness a thousand miracles and this places will show you why.

This place has bike trails, walking trails, recreational parks, rivers, fishing, cliff jumping, barbecues, ponds... you name it, you'll be finding yourself involved with something or someone one way or another.

Wissahickon Park is definitely for all ages and all walks of life. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

Especially to those who go out in nature to be soothed, healed and to have their senses put in order.

Since the park is a decent size and in a valley you feel like you are in nature and not in the city anymore even though it's technically with in the city limits. The park seems to get a bit crowded on the weekends but not too bad and is less populated if you get off of the road and onto one of the smaller trails.

We visited pretty early on a Saturday, and even though the weather was beautiful, it was not as crowded as we thought. Some of the main trails, like Forbidden Drive were pretty busy, but the side trails in the southern end of the park were very quiet. At times it felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. There is a surprising amount of trails to hike here, but at the same time because it's not actually that big, you can cover a lot of ground. My only complaint is that some of the nicer trails are mixed use for hiking and mountain biking. I understand why they do this, but there were a lot of bikers. Everyone was cool, but it takes some of the enjoyment out of hiking when you're constantly looking over your shoulder, waiting the get run over by a bike. Next time, we will avoid the mixed use trails, but otherwise can't wait to be back!",5

It's easy to learn them and hard to get lost. Based on the season, the park takes on a completely different vibe so you can come hear year round and it's almost like being in a different place, even if you're running or hiking trails that you've been on before.
The only drawback is that there are lots of dog owners who let their dogs go off leash, even though it's illegal anywhere in the park, and I've had a couple of encounters with dogs where they went for me. I've never been bitten, but I know people who have, so just be wary of strange dogs you may meet in the park.",5

Update: This has become one of my favorite parks in the area. There's loads of paths to follow, for biking, hiking, or walking. The hiking paths are easy to identify with markers, and there's maps, but it's also just a very family-friendly park that's free from the usual litter you see in parks anymore. Following the Wissahickon just makes it cooler too, especially with all the shade. It's great for your walk in the park for the summer. On incredibly nice days, finding the real entrance with parking is impossible though, so beware. I like to find a close road to park, and walk over, or pick up a trail from there. Everyone in the area seems to know about the park, and it's a decent size, so no wonder they all flock to it when it's nice out!",5

My FH and I visit this park almost every weekend. We love taking different trails according to how long we want to walk and the level of difficulty. The trail-goers are courteous and friendly for the most part. We bring our dog on walks with us unless it's too cold and the trails are usually very dog friendly.
I wish they would open up more bathrooms year round and allow little kiosks to sell water and trail treats along the route because you can be there for hours. The only place to get treats and refreshment is the Valley Green Inn counter and if you're not near it, it's useless.
Really love this park!",5

Dammed up stagnant and algae filled waters turned into rushing clear riffles over rocks.  I can imagine how relaxing and aesthetically pleasing the rest of this expansive park is!

01/17/2017 20:44:50,Eric Parola,104813072774797018112,"Wissahickon Valley Park is a not so hidden, hidden treasure located within the boundaries of Philadelphia. For hikers, trail runners, and mountain bikers, there are over 50 miles of trails with varying terrain from easy to difficult (for Southeast PA). If you're looking for a casual stroll, head down Forbidden Drive alongside the Wissahickon Creek and check out the waterfalls. If you're looking for a challenge, head to the hills surrounding the creek and check out the Wissahickon Gorge. For the most part, the trails are in excellent condition, just be aware there are a lot of rocks and roots to stumble over. Throughout the park, you'll also find ruins and/or remnants of what used to be at one time which has always sparked my interest. If you're hungry or thirsty, make a stop at the Valley Green Inn to replenish yourself. In all, it's a fantastic place to take a day trip if you're in the area.

There are a few items to note if you go there and a reason I didn't give this park a five star rating. First, from time to time and depending on what part of the park you're in, you'll catch the smell of sewage water which isn't horribly bad, but it certainly isn't pleasant either. Second, while no fault of the park itself, there can be quite a bit of trash, especially at places like Devil's Pool. Along with the trash are the dog owners who will clean up after their pet(s), then leave the bag of poo next to the trail instead of finding a waste basket and throwing it away. Despite the trash and dog poo, if you enjoy the outdoors, I'd highly recommended you check this park out.",4

But dont let that scare you!! This place was so much fun I loved the water it was clear & you could see the bottom . The kids & I had a great time jumping off cliffs & little mountains. There are ropes to swing into the water & there is a tree that people walk on & jump from into the water. Its about a hlf mile of walking downhill before you reach the beginning of the park & theres 3 differ areas to swim .Some areas are really shallow & some deep . There is something for everyone. If you cant swim then you can hang in the 1st part of the crick and lay on the rocks & get a tan . Its one of the best kept secrets. Its free to get in but it's also illegal though I was there with tons of other people & the park rangers did nothing. They just stop by I guess to make sure everyone is safe. If you are foolish then this could be a very dangerous place. There is a 50 ft bridge people have jumped from & some lived though some people have died there.  Anyway be smart & be safe. If you wanna see what its all about look up Devils Pool on utube .",5

I used to think the Jersey Shore would be a great day trip when I bought a car, but this beats it out simply for the ease of being here and because it's basically free minus gas money.

The park is active and well very clean. Today I did the orange trail through the valley green east entrance. There's plenty of parking FYI. As for what you'll find, expect mountain bikers, many hikers, walking along the stream, a waterfall, fishing, and semi-strenuous hiking. From 1-10 with 10 being extremely difficult, I'd give the portion I did a 3.5.

Overall, this place is beautiful, lively, and a welcome detour away from Center City!
